# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Description
This app was made as a proof of concept. It is using React Native and Expo to be able to develop a mobile application through a Windows laptop for an iPhone. By downloading the Expo Go App, an iPhone is able to run this code. Expo Go will simply run the code through their Mac servers, which removes the contraint of needing to develop IOS applications with Macs only.
